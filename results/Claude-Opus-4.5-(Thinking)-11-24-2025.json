  "notes": "Claude Opus 4.5 is a hybrid reasoning model that allows users to toggle between a default mode and an 'extended thinking' mode. Performance for this variant varies based on the specified 'effort' parameter or thinking token budget (e.g., 8k, 16k, 32k, 64k, 128k). Benchmarks explicitly designated 'without extended thinking' (such as τ²-Bench, MCP Atlas, and specific Table 2.3.A controls) were omitted. RSP (Responsible Scaling Policy) evaluations (Section 7) primarily utilized extended thinking to determine the capability ceiling for biological, autonomy, and cyber risks."
