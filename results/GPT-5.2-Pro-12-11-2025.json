  "notes": "Benchmark results for the GPT-5.2 Pro variant are extracted from the OpenAI blog post appendix. The accompanying System Card (PDF) specifically evaluates the 'Instant' and 'Thinking' variants and does not include benchmark data for the 'Pro' tier. All reported results for GPT-5.2 Pro were achieved using the maximum reasoning effort setting ('xhigh') available in the API. GDPval subsets represent different human-expert judging methodologies (wins/ties, clear wins, or no-tie head-to-head) for tasks spanning 44 occupations."
