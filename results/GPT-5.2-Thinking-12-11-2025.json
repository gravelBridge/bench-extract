Subsets of the thinking variant performance based on 'reasoning effort' (e.g., none vs heavy vs xhigh) are included for benchmarks where they were explicitly reported. Note that in Preparedness Framework charts in the System Card, the shorthand 'gpt-5.2' refers specifically to the thinking variant. Hallucination rates are provided for both browsing-enabled and disabled configurations across multiple domains."
