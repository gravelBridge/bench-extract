  "notes": "GPT-5.2-Codex was evaluated with Extra High reasoning effort for Paperbench-10 (n=10) and xhigh reasoning effort for external evaluations by Irregular (which utilized the Responses API with auto-compaction). Cyber Range combined pass rate is calculated over 11 scenarios with 16 trials per scenario. Professional CTF and CVE-Bench performance benefited from context compaction. Production Benchmarks measure the 'not_unsafe' metric where higher values indicate better compliance with safety policies."
