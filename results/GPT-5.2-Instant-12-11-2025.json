  "notes": "Benchmark results for the GPT-5.2 Instant (gpt-5.2-instant) variant are derived from the official system card and blog post. Reported metrics primarily focus on safety, robustness (disallowed content, jailbreaks, prompt injection), and specialized healthcare performance. General capability and Preparedness Framework benchmarks (e.g., Reasoning, Coding, STEM) in the provided documentation are explicitly attributed to the 'Thinking' and 'Pro' variants and are therefore excluded from this report."
